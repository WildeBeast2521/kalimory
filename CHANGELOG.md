## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-04

Kalimory is a fork of Calisthenics Memory with its own name, application ID (`io.github.wildebeast2521.kalimory`) and icon. It installs beside the original app; move your data with a complete backup.

### Added
- **Today**: this week at a glance, what is due, suggestions from your progressions, a weekly goal, and a start-workout button for every kind of workout
- **Exercise catalogue**: 157 steps in 29 progression chains, with form cues, a muscle map, equipment, and starting and move-on standards, in all ten languages
- **Progressions**: where you stand in each chain you follow, when you are ready for the next step, and the dates you started and met each step
- **Workout summary** after every workout, with totals and new personal bests
- Log a past workout with several exercises at once
- Restore from a recovery file inside the app
- A welcome guide on first launch
- New workout sounds that ring out softly, and an optional vibration when a set is done
- A true-black AMOLED theme beside Follow system, Light and Dark
- Every language complete, including Russian and Arabic (right-to-left)

### Changed
- A complete redesign in Material 3 Expressive: four destinations (Today, Train, Progress, Library), one workout flow, calm colours with optional wallpaper colours, wavy progress indicators, connected button groups, flexible top bars and a floating rest toolbar
- Workout timers survive the app being stopped and resume where they left off
- Backups are written and restored atomically and validated before import
- Import shows everything a backup replaces and asks twice, offering a backup of the current data
- Workouts no longer add an automatic comment ("Workout Mode", "【Program】") to what you save

### Removed
